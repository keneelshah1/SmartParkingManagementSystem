# Smart Parking Management System
VERSION-1 is built USING ARDUINO whereas VERSION-2 is built USING NODEMCU-ESP8266, WIFI and GOOGLE FIREBASE.

VERSION-1 was developed using ARDUINO but due to cost effectiveness and limitation of wireless connections we redesign the whole project with NODEMCU-ESP8266 which is comparatively cheaper and also has inbuilt WIFI module. So, we uses the google firebase for contineous tracking of vehicles using nodemcu-esp8266 wifi module.
Project have both versions detailed information with circuit and coding in step-by-step format with videos.
